<h1><b>Lesson One: Diving In</b></h1>
<p>When learning a new language, where shall we start?  Especially when the goal is to communicate with a <em>machine</em>, rather than a human being!!!  One intuitive place to begin for newbies is web pages, something that those of us who have only used mices and keyboards are familiar with.</p>

<p><u> <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723400">Browser to Server</a></u></p>
  <p>How do web pages magically appear when we click on a link in our computer's browser?  Apparently, when we click on a hyperlink, the browser sends <em>HyperText Transfer Protocol requests</em> via the Internet to the appropriate <em>server</em>.  That server then identifies the relevant <em>HyperText Markup Language</em> and reverts via the Internet to our browser, which converts the HTTP into the visual webpage for our viewing pleasure.</p>  
  
  <p><u><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48724340">HyperText Markup Language</a></u></p>
<p>What is this HTML that transfers content between browsers and servers?  Apparently, HTML is a language composed of underlying text, references to documents, and links to web pages that browsers and servers understand.  The browser reads the underlying HTML <em>text content</em> to create a visual <em>mark-up</em>, which is what we humans see displayed as the web page in our browser.</p>
<p>HTML text content is structured as a tree of HTML <em>elements</em>, each of which are composed of opening tag, content, followed by closing tag. <em>Tags</em> of the same type denote where each element begins and ends.</p>
<p><u><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-3484369492">Browsers Expect Accuracy</a></u></p>
<p>When speaking "computer" to a browser, people must be specific as to their HTML syntax.  Computers only understand exactly what is conveyed to them, and will not correct for human errors.  For example, forgetting to include the closing tag in the HTML text content of an element (excluding void tags) will result in the continuation of that element because the browser has only been told where to start but not where to end.</p>
<p><u><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723438">Grouping Elements: Inline vs. Block</a></u></p>
<p>Elements are bifurcated into <em>inline</em> and <em>block</em> elements relating to line breaks as displayed in mark-ups.  The former types of elements retains its content in one line.  The latter creates an invisible box around the element and cordons it off; thus, when a block element is used, it appears on its own line.  Examples of inline elements include "a", "b", "em", "img", "strong", "br" and "span".  Examples of block elements include "p", "div" and "form".</p>
